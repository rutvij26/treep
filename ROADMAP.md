# Treep Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for Treep.

## Current Version (1.0.0)

✅ Core graph/tree data structures  
✅ Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path)  
✅ Schema validation  
✅ JSON utilities  
✅ TypeScript support  

## Upcoming Features

### Phase 1: Tree-Specific Operations

- [ ] Pre-order, in-order, post-order traversal
